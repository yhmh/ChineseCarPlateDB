# ChineseCarPlateDB

in the images/ folder, there're one txt file (0.sorted.label.txt) and 879 jpg images.

0.sorted.label.txt is saved in utf-8 format. It has two columns, seperated with comma.
left column is plate number, right column is file name

Some was obtained from internet, some was taken randomly on the streets by myself.


Let me know if there's any mistakes. Thanks
