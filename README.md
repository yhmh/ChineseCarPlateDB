# ChineseCarPlateDB

in the images/ folder, there're one txt file (0.sorted.label.txt) and one zip file.

0.sorted.label.txt is saved in utf-8 format. It has two columns, separated with comma.
Left column is plate number. Right column is file names of each plate image.

zip file contains 879 plate images. Some were obtained from internet, some were taken randomly on streets by myself.


Let me know if there's any mistakes. Thanks
